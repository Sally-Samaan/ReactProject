Event-Finder:
The Event Finder is an app designed to help users discover and keep track of events in a specific city . 
The app features a simple and intuitive interface with three main sections:

_Home Page with Search Bar:
The home page displays a search bar where users can enter the city name to find events. 
Once a search is performed, the app shows a list of relevant events right below the search bar, making it easy for users to explore the search results.

_Event Detail Page:
When users select an event from the search results, they are taken to the event detail page. 
Here, they can view comprehensive information about the selected event, including the event name, date, venue, and a direct link to purchase tickets.

_Favorite Page:
The app includes a dedicated Favourite  page where users can save events they find interesting or plan to attend.. 
They can add or remove events from their favourites  list, ensuring they never miss out on their preferred events.



The app uses the Api from ticket master.
